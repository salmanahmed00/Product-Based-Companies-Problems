You are given an array of integers ARR[] of size N consisting of zeros and ones. You have to select a subset and flip bits of that subset. 
You have to return the count of maximum oneâ€™s that you can obtain by flipping chosen sub-array at most once.
A flip operation is one in which you turn 1 into 0 and 0 into 1.
